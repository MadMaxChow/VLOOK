[^Typora]: Typora is a cross-platform Markdown editor (perhaps the best editor at the moment), which supports direct preview and editing. For more detailed features, please refer to the [official websit](https://www.typora.io).

# Prepared For

==If you also have one or more of the following needs or pain points, you can safely try the Markdown-based document solution for document editing, publishing, and management. The recommended combination is **Typora + VLOOK™**==

- Using Markdown to write documentation, but with higher demands for the layout and interactivity of either the Markdown editor or its generated HTML output.
- For the documents you write, you hope that *???**Unified template and output***_~T1~_ ,  and preferably *???**Change theme any time***_~T2~_
- You want to focus solely on writing the content, and wish for the tedious tasks of content arrangement and formatting to be automated.
- You aim to reduce expenses on software tools like Word for documentation or Visio for diagramming, or simply find the formatting operations in these tools tiresome.
- You need support for cross-platform and cross-device document viewing and publishing.
- The output documents should provide interactive assistance tools during reading, review, or presentation—such as a table of contents/captions index, spotlight, laser pointer, footnotes, and so on.

## Live Mode Installation

**First, complete the setup of your own web site, and then proceed with the following resource deployment, site domain adjustments, and related operations.**

### Live Plugin & Font

_^tab^_

> **Reference Web Fonts**
>
> 1. Open all **CSS files** starting with `fs-` under *==released/**theme-live**/**Vxx.x**==* with a text editor.
> 2. Search for all `<your-host>` entries, replace them with the domain of the web site, and save.
> 3. Upload the updated files to the corresponding directory of the web site after completing the update.

> **Deploy Online Plugins and Web Fonts**
>
> 1. Upload *==released/**plugin-live**/**Vxx.x**==* to the root directory of the web site.
> 2. Download the latest version of [openfonts](https://github.com/MadMaxChow/openfonts/releases) from GitHub (e.g., `web-font-V2.0.tar.gz`).
> 3. After extraction, upload all the subdirectories inside (e.g., `s`, `v`) to the resource directory of the corresponding VLOOK online version on the web site (e.g., `V2025.10.1`).



> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - The above `Vxx.x` refers to the corresponding version identifier, such as `V2025.10.1`, which serves as the resource directory for the VLOOK online version.
> - If the HTML files published with older versions of themes or plugins are not republished, you need to keep the original version directories and not delete them.

### Live Themes

_^tab^_

> **Install Online Theme**
>
> 1. Open the required "online version" theme file in the *==released/**themes-live**==* directory (e.g., `vlook-live-hope.css`) with a text editor.
> 2. Search for all `<your-host>` entries in the file, replace them with the domain of the web site, and save.
> 3. Refer to the above "[Install Theme Package](#install-theme-package)" method, and copy the modified "online version" theme file into Typora's theme directory.

> **Deploy Theme Files to the Web Site**

> 3. Upload the updated files to the corresponding directory of the web site after completing the update.

### Live Export Options

>    - `<meta name="vlook-js" ...>` - the URL of the subdirectory containing js files
>    - `<meta name="vlook-fs" ...>` - the URL of the subdirectory containing web font files

> **Configure Export Options**
>
> Refer to the above "[Configure Export Options](#configure-export-options)" steps, and create a new export configuration for the online mode. The main differentiated handling is as follows:  
>
> - It is recommended to add `(live)` to the export configuration name for distinction, e.g., `VLOOK (live)`
> - What needs to be pasted is the "online plugin" *==released/plugin/**plugin_live.txt**==*



> [!TIP]
>
> The current document, along with all Markdown documents of the VLOOK™ [Guide](guide-en.md) and more sample documents, can be found under *==released/**samples**==*.
