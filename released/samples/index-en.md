## Online Version

The above configuration method is an offline plug-in. The complete plug-in code is integrated with HTML files. It is suitable for situations where an intranet or no network is required when browsing documents, but it is not convenient to update plug-ins in real time and [switch template themes online](guide2.md#模板主题) .

At present, VLOOK™ supports the online version of plug-in. You can refer to the above method to add a new "export configuration" (it is recommended to name the configuration `VLOOK (live)` ).

The online version of the plugin file is: *==released/plugin/**plugin_live.txt**==*
